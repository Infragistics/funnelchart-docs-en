= {FunnelChartName}

== Purpose

The purpose of this topic is to introduce the funnel chart. A funnel chart is a type of chart that displays quantities as percentages of a whole, much like a pie chart. Funnel charts are commonly used to display quantitative data in relation to stages of a process. For example, a funnel chart might display expenses of a product from the manufacturing stage to the actual sale of that product.
